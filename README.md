A Machine Learning-Powered Movie Suggestion Engine(Collaborative Filtering/Memory based)

## 
Mainly, there are 2 types of recommendation systems: Content-based and Collaborative Filtering. Content based is driven by : “I need to see more of what I like” and tries to figure out what a user’s favourite attributes of an item are and then make recommendations based on those aspects. Content based implies that it uses the past preferences or ratings of the user on movies already watched to suggest other movies.

Collaborative Filtering is based on, “Tell me what’s popular among my friends and other users and I would like to watch that too!” It tries to find group of users who are most similar and provide recommendation to one particular user based on the similar liking within the group. This is compartively more complex and less seen on Netflix, according to my own personal observation.

Implementation of recommender systems is of two types: Memory-based and Model-based. Memory-based approach uses the entire user-tiem dataset to generate a recommendation using statistical techniques like Pearson Correlation, Euclidean distance, Cosine Similarity, etc. Model-based approach builds a model of users to learn their preferences and is created using Machine Learning techniques like regression, clustering, classification.
## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package installer
- A list of python packages that are required for the project to run. You can find these packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine by running `git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git`
2. navigate to the project directory by running `cd [repository-name]`
3. Create a virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv [environment_name]` 
4. Activate the virtual environment by running `source [environment_name]/bin/activate`
5. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. You are now ready to run the project on your local machine

### Running the project
1. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor
2. Run the main script file, for example `python manage.py runserver`
3. The project will now be running on your local host.


### Usage

Run terminal:

`python manage.py runserver`

It means to run a emulated server on your local computer. So, after running it, you can go to localhost:8000 or 127.0. 0.1:8000. Requirements: You must run this in the ROOT of your django project where manage.py lives.

### Data

db.sqlite3  database file where all the data that you will be generating will be stored. It is a local file as Django is a server-side framework and it treats your computer as the host when you actually run the server in command line/terminal.

### Model

The process for creating a User Based recommendation system is as follows:

-Select a user with the movies the user has watched

-Add movieIds to the movies watched by the user for easy recommendation

-Based on his rating to movies, find the top X neighbours

-Get the watched movie record of the user for each neighbour.

-Calculate a similarity score using some formula

-Recommend the items with the highest score
